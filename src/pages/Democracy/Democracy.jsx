          I guess my favorite color is brown. It reminds me of the autumn blaze.
          Red, orange, yellow- every leaf tells me its story, fluttering from
          the tree. But my story began and ended quickly like a Sunday morning.
          Now everyday feels like Monday. I wasted all those yesterdays and am
          completely out of tomorrows. I am scared, because I might forget his
          swarthy cappuccino face, his big coffee almond-shaped eyes, his little
          mole under his bottom lip, his chocolate brown hair. But my favorite
          color is brown, isn’t it? <br />
          <br /> Even now when I think of him, his smile, his magnetizing touch,
          I still feel pain right there in the back of my throat, like a cold
          lump, stranded ship in dead cold waters. Today I am living in the
          shadows, a shadow that no longer exists… What difference does it make
          to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction
          is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of
          democracy? There is no difference. In the midst of war, our love found
          a way to bloom amidst the chaos. They have so much in common and the
          main similarity between love and war is that they are easy to begin,
          but very hard to stop. <br />
          <br /> On the other hand, human malice has no beginning and no end,
          but is eternal. Evil people are at eternal war, in which they are
          captive… of their words, thoughts, of other people’s lives and
          actions. Democracy protects us from the people themselves with laws,
          but who is going to protect us from the chorus opinion? How I am going
          to avoid the judging faces when I am crossing the streets of
          Jerusalem, hand in hand with my beloved Lieber? How I am going to
          avoid their whispering behind my back? I do not care anymore, because
          the conflict took everything away from me. People say that democracies
          are less likely to go on war. Absolute bullshit. The war between
          Israelis and Palestinians is never going to end. “War may tear us
          apart”, they said, “but love will always find a way to bring us back
          together”. No. Our love story didn’t change anything, but they
          separated us forever. <br />
          <br /> Allegedly, we live in a democratic society, in which I am a
          prisoner of my own fate. I am a woman. A Palestinian one. Actually, a
          girl, but the “democratic life” forced me to grow up fast. I am at
          war, trying to protect myself and my younger siblings. There is always
          someone, who tells me how to behave or… as they say “act
          democratically”: Do not be loud; Keep your head down; Keep your legs
          shut; Keep your mouth shut; Smile; What are you wearing; Forgive and
          forget; Take the blame; Cover up; Try less make up; Lose some weight;
          Beauty is pain; Sacrifice; Do not stand out. “It’s just part of being
          a woman, Salma”, my mother used to say. It is a destiny of a woman to
          suffer. <br />
          <br /> Also I fell in love with the “enemy”. It’s not my fault. The
          heart wants what it wants. All is fair in love and war, but neither
          love nor war is fair. Because in this world of politics, race and
          religion, only love has rules. I fell for the boy, whose eyes were as
          bright as pearls. We crave most what we can’t have. But the world and
          reality will never approve of us. Our love was like a rose with
          thorns- beautiful, but dangerous; like a fairytale, but I was no
          princess and he was no prince; like a fruit with sweet taste, but
          bitter in the eyes of others.
          <br />
          <br />
          Forbidden love is a flame that burns brighter in the shadows, where I
          was hidden. It whispers our secrets in the silence of the starry
          nights. Nights I was praying harder than ever for our sweetest sin to
          be forgiven. Lieber and I don’t see religion as a barrier. But
          everyone else does. My mother didn’t take it well. Our relationship
          went against her religious values for me to date anyone, let alone a
          non-Muslim. -
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s haram, Salma. Are you out of your mind?- my mother was shattering
          my heart like a glass and tears streamed down my face. The most
          painful thing in life is not a cut or a burn. As a child I never
          understood how love could hurt, but growing up I realized- nothing is
          as painful as love. Especially, the ones that are left unfinished,
          with all the what-ifs and maybes left hanging in the air. But love has
          no religion, right? No race. No boundaries. And democracy is freedom,
          right? Then why I can’t freely fall in love? Even in a democratic
          world, we are not free and independent. Everyone is at war with
          different things. Even with themselves… <br />
          <br /> - You don’t see what I see in hi- - What did you see? You wanna
          know what I am seeing now? A monster. You are a bad example for your
          siblings. What would people say about you when you are fooling around
          him? About me? About us? My daughter is ungrateful, that she is with
          Israeli, she is a traitor. Right? They will stone us to death with
          words; they will burn us alive with gazes. This is what you want. You
          want to embarrass me. <br />
          <br /> The disapproval of my mother hung over my head like a storm
          cloud. For the safety of my siblings, she kicked me out. She was
          afraid that soldiers would come and kill them because of me. But I
          knew that wasn’t the reason. My mother wanted to protect the
          reputation of the family. It is easily blown out like a candle, in the
          hands of others, no one else controls it. <br />
          <br /> - I love you even with pimples on your face.- Lieber was
          admiring me with his cinnamon brown eyes. He was braiding me. His
          fingertips were touching my neck occasionally, where every touch
          unlocked my soul. - You do like them? You are weird. <br />
          <br /> - Yep. Why not? I do not consider myself as weird or strange… I
          must say, hmmm, unique?- Yes, he was unique. I have been stuck in the
          dark for a very long time, waiting for a love like this to come along
          and light me up inside. Lieber was heavenly. I was sure that angels
          drew his face. His soul was so bright that I sometimes confused it
          with the moon. He had one of those smiles… a smile you can’t help but
          smile when he smiled. <br />
          <br /> - You remind me of home, but unlike home, you actually make me
          feel safe. Home? It is just a house for me. A roof and 4 walls.
          Anything but a safe place. “Home” is a mess. It is screaming, yelling
          and crying from the basement to the top floor. But home doesn’t have
          to be a place, it could be someone… that welcomes you with open arms
          and squeezes you tightly. My “home” never raises his voice or throw
          stuff around, never makes me feel guilty for things I have no control
          over, never makes me feel bad for expressing my feelings. A person who
          accepts every part of me. <br />
          <br /> - I wish I could hug you. You really don’t want me to jump the
          fence? It’s not that tall. I will be fine. Okay? - I will never
          forgive myself for letting him jump. Yes. He hugged me tightly and
          kissed me as sweet as summer rain on thirsty leaves. I kissed my boy
          who brought me to life again minutes before our tragic end.- I would
          have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if
          this was all the time we were allowed to have… the wait was worth it.
          Death has taken so much from me. It has stolen our conversations,
          laughter, silence, plans, moments, the future we thought we would
          have. In my mind it’s still September and our story just started. In
          quiet whispers of my soul, Lieber’s name was echoing. We were dancing
          in the rain. The leaves of my heart were watering by feelings for him.
          Our first kiss… felt like fireworks, the touch of his lips on mine was
          like liquid. He pulled away and smiled before he kissed me again. But
          I never knew kissing him could get me addicted to the taste of his
          lips. Under the moon we counted the stars, while my moon was sitting
          by my side. Beautiful and mysterious. His light was soft to my eyes in
          a way where I could look at him for hours. Kind and gentle. He shined
          bright in my dark life. Hugging. Lieber wrapped his arms around me so
          tight to remind me that everything will be okay. My organs were
          working, my brain was thinking, my heart was beating. Then I heard a
          gunshot. I could feel myself slipping out of Lieber’s arms. The only
          thing I remember was the warmth of his hug and the moon, shining
          brightly like the sun. A tragically beautiful thing. My hand was cold,
          his was as hot as fire. Death is not the greatest loss in life. The
          greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. Betrayal. It never
          comes from enemies. Familial betrayal is the most heart-breaking,
          because if you can’t trust your family to love and protect you, who
          can you really trust? My own mother shot me, thinking it was Lieber,
          the “enemy” I fell in love with. Originally, the plan was me betraying
          her… funny how the tables have turned. <br />
          <br /> Loving Lieber was never wrong, never a mistake. Hearts follow
          their own rules. Like finding water in the middle of the desert, I
          found the oasis of my life… in this world of toxicity, it is hard to
          locate someone who could make you feel that there was a reason you’d
          been put on this earth. But death is so beautiful… lying in soft brown
          earth with the grasses waving above one’s head, listening to silence,
          having no yesterday, no tomorrow… being at peace, because in this
          democratic world, peace is only possible after war. <br />
          <br /> Let’s not think about the end. If I had another chance at life,
          I’d do everything the same just so I could meet Lieber again. In my
          story, he will always be my favorite chapter. I have loved the night
          sky since I was little, but I never expected to be part of it so soon.
          I know so many last words. But I never know hers… but I have only one
          question- what people said after you killed me, mother? Till the next
          eclipse, my moon!
