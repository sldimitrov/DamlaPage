          My father- my hope` Kabul was a beautiful city until the war. So was
          now… the city just lost its sparkle when I was left without any
          relatives. Brown plains lead to stark mountains and snow-capped peaks
          surrounding the valley in which our capital sits. The Kabul River
          flows through the heart of the city, dividing the central bazaars with
          the smell of fresh spices. My father and I used to go there to sell
          whatever we found to have money to live on. It was just me and him. He
          was my warrior, my savior. He was the only relative I had. <br />
          <br /> I loved my father more than anything. There are not enough
          words to describe how important was my bāba to me. A good girl in
          Afghanistan should be silent so everyone can play with her like a
          doll. Because of the Taliban, Afghanistan has become a jail for women.
          My father Kadir taught me the opposite that I should be independent,
          that I am equal to any other man. He was not the typical Afghan. I was
          his flower. He watered me but he never stopped me from growing. Maybe
          that was the reason why I loved him that much. <br />
          <br /> I remember that day… when the war started, when the men had to
          protect the city. -I promise, Aziza! I promise! I will be back!- dad
          said, but I couldn’t let go of his hand.- I will be back before you
          wake up, before you open your eyes!- People say that eyes are windows
          to the soul. I looked him straight in the eyes. I knew he was lying.
          But neither of us had a choice. He wanted to protect my 12 years old
          body and soul, to keep me away from these monsters. <br />
          <br /> -I hope you come back! I am waiting you, bāba! I was afraid of
          being alone and I couldn’t sleep. I was sitting by the window. It was
          raining outside. It was pouring rain. From time to time, sparks and
          thunder flew across the sky. But that was the least of my problems. I
          was hoping to see my dad again, to hug him. The only thing I could do
          was pray to Allah to protect him. <br />
          <br /> It has already stopped raining. Hours passed one by one slowly.
          The house was silent. I could hear my own breathing. It was driving me
          crazy. It was dark. The sun set down. I was too scared to get a
          candle, I barely moved. The street lamp was barely glowing, only the
          moonlight lightened the room and my father’s photo which I was holding
          with my hand. For me- hope was the light of my soul. Hope was being
          able to see that there was light despite all of the darkness. <br />
          <br /> The day passed. I was still waiting. My lips were dry, but my
          eyes were wetter than the dirt outside. I was hungry. I was starving.
          But the worry was eating me up inside. My bāba didn’t come back. I
          didn’t pay attention to the tanks passing by. I was hoping to see the
          familiar face of my dad. But there were no people outside at all. The
          street was empty and it was quiet. Very quiet. I thought it was not
          dangerous so I decided to went out and look up for daddy. <br />
          <br /> When I crossed the street I was devastated. I could feel the
          blood through my veins; I could hear my heartbeat in my ear. One of
          the Taliban was pulling a girl, I guess around my age, by the hair and
          was dragging her down one of the dark streets. A mother had fallen to
          the ground and was embracing her murdered child. On the other side, a
          woman was begging to be let go because her son was waiting for her to
          come back. <br />
          <br /> What have I done? Why I even left the house? Who’s going to
          open the door for daddy? Is he begging the Taliban like the woman? I
          couldn’t go back home. <br />
          <br /> They have already seen me. They will follow me and even could
          kill me. <br />
          <br /> Are these men even men? A woman brought them into this world,
          so they have no right to disrespect one. Real men treat women with the
          dignity and respect they deserve. My bāba would never do this to any
          woman. <br />
          <br /> I decided to hide behind a broken fence. I hoped no one would
          find me. People passed me by, not knowing that someone was hiding
          behind the ruins. And if they had known, I don't think they would have
          stopped to help me. It's every man for himself in a state of war. Next
          to me were many stones, apparently the remains of the destroyed fence.
          Beneath them were many crushed snowflakes, lifeless. Only one of them
          had survived, there was a drop of blood on the white bell. I decided
          to tear it off to bring me luck and to remind me not to lose hope. I
          am my father's flower that will survive. <br />
          <br /> After a while I heard footsteps approaching me. I kept calm and
          peeked to see who it was. I saw male legs - two men. <br />
          <br /> - I understand you have another family to feed, but think
          twice. Will you sell Aziza, your only daughter, to feed your sons who
          can fend for themselves in this country? Kadir, think carefully! - I
          have no choice, Hassan! After all, she will be better off, she will
          have food, water, shelter. I'll go get her now. Ahmad is waiting for
          her. <br />
          <br /> They left. That day I was left fatherless, without relatives.
          It was not the war that killed him, but my hope. He plucked his flower
          to feed his wolves. I didn't even know there was another family, I
          didn't even know I had brothers. I wanted to get out from under the
          ruins and to look him in the eyes like last time. But I didn't. I
          stood in the same place, hoping that my bāba, who raised me, would
          come back and save me. Not my father who sold me. My bāba… <br />
          <br /> I remained forever under the ruins, but my soul wandered and
          sought my dad. My bāba, who I hoped would return… who didn’t betray
          me. Do you know what the saddest thing about betrayal is? It never
          comes from your enemies.
