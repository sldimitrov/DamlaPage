<p>
 ⚙️ Lets begin with the JSX syntax that is something specific for this framework.
Another crucial concept I have used in action are the components. They involve working with HTML, CSS and JS in order to being develop. <br/>
 I have used useContext to derive the state everywhere I need it. Other hooks that were implement in my project are useState, useEffect, useMemo and useCallback.
 
 ### To sum up the tech-stack:
* Core: `React, JavaScript, HTML` <br/>
* Additional libraries: `Tailwind`

She was the UI/UX designer most of the time. Not also that but she never missed to find some typo's not in my code but in the text instead!
