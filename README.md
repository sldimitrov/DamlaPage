## Knowledge stack: <⚛️/> 
 ### Many core principles in React were applied as I have been developing this project.
<img align="right" width="340" height="190" alt="react core concepts" src="https://github.com/sldimitrov/ReactWeatherApp/assets/135168991/7b864aeb-9cf4-49a4-905e-ec10290f2932" /> 
<p>
 ⚙️ Lets begin with the JSX syntax that is something specific for this framework.
Another crucial concept I have used in action are the components. They involve working with HTML, CSS and JS in order to being develop. <br/>
 I have used useContext to derive the state everywhere I need it. Other hooks that were implement in my project are useState, useEffect, useMemo and useCallback.
 
 ### To sum up the tech-stack:
* Core: `React, JavaScript, HTML` <br/>
* Additional libraries: `Tailwind`
</p>

## Credits: 📝
### This project is course work for my internship in Orbis. <br/>
* Here I want to express my gratitude for the author Ms. `Damla Kemik` 🙏 <br/>
She was the UI/UX designer most of the time. Not also that but she never missed to find some typo's not in my code but in the text instead!
